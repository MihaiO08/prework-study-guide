## Description

This is a webpage created for the purpose of helping me with my bootcamp study. It is designed to store notes I have made and that I can easily come back to should I need to in the future.
Throughout this project I have learned how to apply Html, CSS, but especially JavaScript concepts at a basic level.

## Installation
